# cyart-vapt-week-4
This repository documents my Week 4 internship work at Cyart Tech, where I worked in the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) domain. The focus of this week was to gain hands-on experience in offensive security practices through structured lab-based simulations.

The work includes:
1. Advanced exploitation using the Metasploit Framework.
2. Web and API security testing on OWASP Juice Shop
3. JWT analysis and IDOR vulnerability testing
4. Privilege escalation and persistence techniques on vulnerable systems
5. Network protocol attacks including MITM, SMB relay, and hash capture
6. Mobile application security assessment using MobSF
7. Professional VAPT-style vulnerability documentation with impact and remediation

All testing activities were conducted in controlled and authorized lab environments such as TryHackMe VPN labs and intentionally vulnerable virtual machines. No unauthorized systems were targeted.
This repository reflects practical cybersecurity skills, real-world attack simulation experience, and structured vulnerability reporting aligned with industry standards.
